# Crowdfunding Finance Management System

The project aims to design and develop a database-driven real estate management system. The system will allow multiple real estate agents to post and manage property listings, while clients can search and view properties based on various criteria.

The backend will be implemented using a relational database to maintain records of agents, properties, clients, and related activities. The database will support CRUD operations, triggers, stored procedures, and analytical queries to provide meaningful insights such as property availability and popularity trends. A web-based graphical user interface (GUI) will be built to enable smooth interaction with the database for agents, clients, andÂ administrators.
